# EECS-731-Project-6

This project aims to detect anomalies in a dataset where data was gathered over a period of several days. The data comes from the Minnesota Department of Transportation and tracks traffic in the Minneapolis/St. Paul area.

Anomalies in time series data can be somewhat difficult to detect when forecasting data. Historical data was used in this project, however. Statistical analysis using quartiles and KMeans clustering are the primary methods of anomaly tracking that were utilized.
